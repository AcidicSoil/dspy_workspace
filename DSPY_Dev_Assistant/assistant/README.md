# assistant – Purpose

## About
Modules and signature definitions for the DSPy Developer Assistant. These components implement the assistant's reasoning and verification capabilities.

## Contents
- `modules.py` – DSPy modules composing the assistant's workflow.
- `signatures.py` – Pydantic-based schemas describing module inputs and outputs.

## How to Use
Imported by `../main.py` to construct the complete assistant. Extend these modules to add new capabilities or modify behavior.

## Development Notes
Depends on `dspy` and `pydantic` for schema validation.

## Status/TODO
Future work includes additional modules for documentation retrieval and code execution.

## Contents
- `main.py` – example script persisting a simple conversation to disk.

## How to Use
Run `python main.py` to generate a conversation log and verify that past messages are retained between runs.

## Development Notes
The example is intentionally minimal and relies only on `dspy` and the standard library.

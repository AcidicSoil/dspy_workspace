# Nexa Sdk

> The Nexa SDK aims to provide a flexible, cross-platform inference framework that enables running large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models on diverse hardware, including Qualcomm NPUs. It supports local inference, model deployment, and integration with an OpenAI-compatible API server, while offering compatibility with multiple model formats and hardware backends.

**Remember:**
- On-device inference for text, image, and audio processing
- Cross-platform support for CPU, GPU, and Qualcomm NPU
- OpenAI-compatible REST API server
- Model format support: GGUF, MLX, and custom .nexa
- CLI tools for model inference, management, and deployment
- Hardware-agnostic backend compatibility (CUDA, Metal, Vulkan)
